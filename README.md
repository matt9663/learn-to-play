# Learn2Play Guitar App

## Description
This app is designed to help users aggregate all the neccesary materials needed to teach themselves to play and sing a song on the guitar. The user searches by Artist and Song Title and the app will pull in the song lyrics, a Youtube video of the song for listening reference, and a link to an external guitar tablature site. The goal is to help the user easily pull together all the materials they need to start learning, as opposed to them having to comb through bunch of different sources. 

Live version can be found on [Github Pages](https://matt9663.github.io/learn-to-play/).
